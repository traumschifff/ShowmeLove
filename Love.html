    <h1>Love</h1> 
    <br>
    <p>Love is a concept that loosely connects intimacy/ kinship/ relatedness/ pleasure/ seduction/ desire/ libido. It functions as a lubricant or incentive to facilitate an exchange. In our “libidinal economy*”, love could induce a trade of <a href="fertilewater.html">fertile fluids</a>, <a href="Money.html">currencies</a>, <a href="CapiatlismandtheSea.html">goods</a>, or services. </p>
    <p>When this broad notion of love is drastically <a href="reductionbygraphicdesign.html">reduced</a> reduced by the normative economic motivations, it turns into mere <a href="shrimpandeellove.html">reproduction</a>. More-than-human love is not the most precise interest of capitalism, yet what matters is only the production of bodies that can be <a href="commodificationbygraphicdesign.html">commodified</a> and sold. </p>
    <p>Throwing love into the equation of commodified reproduction means to raise a caring question. In which condition is reproduction happening? What <a href="EcologicalUrgency.html">environmental conditions</a> need to be met in order to facilitate <a href="mthagency.html">free-will</a> intercourse? What quality must the water have? Does the water contain toxins? Widening reproduction into love allows us a more comprehensive view on the sustenance of <a href="Deleuziandiagram.html">interconnected</a> ecosystems. </p>
