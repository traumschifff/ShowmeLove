            <p>We were particularly interested in <a href="howitstarted.html">the idea of shrimps and eels having agency in an economic context</a>. For instance, the commercial production of freshwater eels entirely relies on their intercourse taking place at the heart of <a href="fertilewater.html">the Atlantic Ocean</a> which no humans has ever witnessed. Humans have long been attempting to <a href="love.html">reproduce</a> eels artificially but this hasnâ€™t been successful yet. Eels are becoming more unavailable in the market since <a href="ecologicalurgency.html">their population declined drastically in the late 1980s</a>, and there has been even more significant demand for humans to study how eels reproduce. Itâ€™s not a coincidence that the majority of eel knowledge is produced in the countries in which eels are consumed as a source of food. Similarly, German shrimp farmers could not produce the right circumstances for a reliable reproduction of shrimps in their tanks. The shrimps, and their reasons to engage or not engage in mating, became a decisive economic factor to the farmers. 
            </p>
            <p>What if we regarded shrimps and eels as economic subjects that hold <a href="mthagency.html">agency</a> in the economic systems relying on their exploitation? And how would we <a href="mthcommunication.html">communicate</a> that notion?
