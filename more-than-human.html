    <h1>More-than-human</h1>

            <p>There are many terms to describe more-than-human entities: more-than-human, nonhuman, terrestrials, earth others, resources, externalities, and nature, just to name a few. Each reflects a specific philosophical stance. 'Resource' and 'externalities,' for example, are used in economic contexts and carry a clear extractivist undertone.
            </p>
            <p>The term 'nature,' as opposed to 'culture,' is prevalent in Western European thought, influenced by the Christian belief that humans are the pinnacle of God's creation. This terminology has been criticized for prioritizing the latter over the former, justifying extractivist practices, and viewing 'nature' as a freely usable gift for humans. Moreover, scholars like Donna Haraway have challenged the distinction between nature and culture, demonstrating their mutual influence.
            </p>
            <p>The binary distinction between 'human' and 'nonhuman' is also problematic. Although 'nonhuman' includes technological entities, it perpetuates the idea that something uniquely 'human' separates us from all other life forms, matter, and intelligence. The term 'earth others' is critiqued similarly; 'others' and 'non' reinforce an 'us versus them' mindset.
            </p>
            <p>'Terrestrials' circumvents binary thinking by including all entities tied to our shared location in the universe. However, its relevance diminishes when considering the impact of space activity on our daily lives, such as satellite communications and the space industry's economic and ecological effects.
            </p>
            <p>Ultimately, we prefer 'more-than-human' because it captures everything beyond the human scope while acknowledging human connections. Yet, we aspire to find a term that is not anthropocentric, acknowledging how human activity has profoundly altered all life on Earth during the Anthropocene.
