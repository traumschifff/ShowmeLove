            <p>“Diverse economies” is a field of research inspired by the work of feminist economic geographer J.K. Gibson-Graham. They strive to reframe “the economy” by seeing it as a site for ethical action, and highlighting that there is no such thing as a global singular capitalist economy, but rather a complex network of multiple systems that work to sustain their livelihood. On that basis, alternative economic imaginaries are created and theorized.</p>
            <p>Particularly interesting to us is that it talks about the necessity to rethink how we frame more-than-human agents, or “Earth Others” in their wording. Human capitalism relies on interspecies production activities such as the reproduction of plants and animals in agriculture or photosynthesis. Through that, more-than-human agents participate in economies sustaining human activities. To date, economic theory, however, mainly offers a focus on human livelihoods functioning at the expense of planetary livelihoods. Diverse economists, therefore, see a need to consider more-than-humans as we draw up models of earthly economies. 
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, we’ve interviewed Ethan Miller, a diverse economist turned sustainable apple farmer, on his theory of more-than-human agency. Based on these inputs, we speculated what diagramming diversely could mean.</p>
