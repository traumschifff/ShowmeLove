            <p>Though a diagram typically refers to <a href="reductionbygraphicdesign.html">a graphic composition of lines and arrows</a>, we prefer to understand it as a concept that functions not to represent, but rather to communicate the relations between its components. We find Deleuze and Guattari's idea valuable; in their book "A Thousand Plateaus," they insist that the diagram refers to <a href="moniac.html">an abstract machine</a>, "the map of relations between forces," “that can be utilized or made manifest in various situations”.
            </p>
            <p class="quote">"The diagram does not resemble particular elements in an imitative way; rather, it displays abstract functions that make up a system. The diagram is the dynamic, fluctuating process occurring between static structures. As a concept, it describes the flexible, elastic, incorporeal functions before they settle into a definitive form."<a href="#footnote1" id="reference1" class="asterisk">*</a>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, we understand a diagram as something that becomes, rather than something that is. In this sense, any networked system can be perceived as a diagram. A room full of people, like an economic system or a measuring apparatus, can be an <a href="embodiment.html">embodied form</a> of diagramming. By emphasizing <a href="diagrammingporously.html">the fluid and dynamic attributes</a> of the displayed relations, a Deleuzian diagram allocates agency to the subjects included in it.
