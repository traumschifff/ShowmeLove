            <p>Hydrofeminism, coined by Astrida Neimanis, sees water in its omnipresence on Earth as a starting point for a new branch of eco-feminist philosophy. Water, mediating the reproductive economies of marine creatures, swirls, drips, flows, overflows, evaporates, rains, freezes, and snows. It carries memories and information, such as hormones, eggs, or energy, passed on from one place to another. This results in an intrinsic need to consider all life forms as connected and interrelated.
            </p>
            <p>Imagining a diagrammatic language that is as fluidic, ambiguous, and transformative as water was not only relevant for us to represent the reproduction of aquatic species but also a meaningful approach for us to unlearn the modern notion of diagramming and perceive the complexity of the world through it.
            </p>
            <p>How does this idea inform the understanding of the economy?
