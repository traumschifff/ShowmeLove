    <h1>Show me Love</h1> 
    <br>
    <p>We started our collaboration after discovering a considerable overlap
        between our research topics. For instance, as Noam began querying how
        eels might perceive human sex, Sarah was investigating anthropocentric
        visualisations of shrimp intercourse. We share a common criticism on
        the exploitative and profit-driven relationship between humans and some
        aquatic species, that we would like to explore in Show me Love, our first
        collaborative project. Humans are pervertedly fascinated by the intimate
        life of other species by the normative motivations. Can we take the eel’s and
        shrimp’s perspective on things also into account?
