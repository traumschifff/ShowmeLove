      <p class="quote">“Watery language naturalizes the movements of capital. To the degree that it is carried
        by aqueous imagery, capital is figured as a necessity, no less a biospheric feature than
        an ocean or a raincloud. Everyday metaphors imply that the “circulation” of wealth is
        as fundamental to the maintenance of life as the blood flowing through the veins of vascularized
        creatures, or the arterial branchings of river deltas. However, water is more
        than fundamental, essential, and “natural”; these aquatic images carry other powerful
        associations, as well. The ocean has long been regarded as a place of uncertainty and
        risk; it can be navigated more or less bravely, but never controlled. Like the unruly
        floodwaters feared by early civilizations, the movements of capital can, at any moment,
        crush a nascent economy, dispense or withdraw prosperity. “Flows” of investment can
        also blast the top off of a local mountain, poison air and water, and displace communities.
        Cloaked in a watery guise, the devastations wrought by floods or droughts of
        capital may be more readily interpreted as unfortunate inevitabilities.”
        </p>
        <p>Still, Water metaphors help to figure a wide range of concepts and experiences, including time, emotional life, and collective identity. Can we reframe water in an anti-capitalist manner?
