            <p class="quote">“What fictions can do, regardless of how dystopian or utopian they may seem, is to identify how the interests of different people and different species conflict – as well as to highlight the areas of the Venn diagram where they do overlap.”<a href="#footnote1" id="reference1" class="asterisk">1</a>
            </p>
            <p>The relationship between diagramming and facilitation is mutual. As much as diagramming can be enriched by careful facilitation, a practice of facilitation can adopt collective diagramming as a method of sharing various perspectives about an obscure system/institution. A diagram can embrace the political, economic, and cultural complexity and reveal the shared ground of perception where considerate conversation can begin among heterogeneous stakeholders.
            </p>
            <p>In both cases of facilitation for diagramming, or diagramming for facilitation, the role of a designer becomes ambiguous with that of a facilitator, “to make it easy for people with shared intentions to be around each other and move towards their vision and value.”<a href="#footnote2" id="reference2" class="asterisk">2</a> And this process will, in turn, be visible in a diagram through its nuances. When a diagram is drawn by a group of people around a table, there won’t be a singular direction through which it can be read. Negotiation in diagramming doesn’t mean homogenizing differences, but finding ways for those to coexist without excessive tension. A diagram that is carefully facilitated can therefore include various ideas, disciplines, languages and senses, no longer confined in boxes and lines drawn on paper.
